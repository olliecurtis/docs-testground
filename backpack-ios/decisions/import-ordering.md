# Import ordering

## Decision
Imports should be organised into the following groups:
 - Import of header in `.m` files
 - System frameworks
 - Other third party frameworks
 - Backpack imports
 - Quoted imports

Within the groups, imports should appear in alphabetical order. (`clang-format` is able to order them alphabetically for you.)

## Thinking
Makes our imports more consistent and easier to navigate.
